	README for GccFindHit V1.2, 25/05/95

This tool should be used in conjunction with Enforcer.
Its purpose is to find the source name/line corresponding to a given offset
in the executable. Very simple to use:
when your program named, say, 'prog', is a bad boy
and makes Enforcer hit(s), remember the offset(s) of the hit(s) displayed
by Enforcer and run the command 'GccFindHit prog <list of offsets in hex>'
The offsets are separated by blanks.
Enforcer gives also the hunk number, but it should always be zero.
If it's not and your program is compiled by gcc, please let me know
about it.
GccFindHit understands the stabs from the aout format encapsulated
in the debug hunk of the AmigaOS executable, so it will work as
long as ld outputs its debug information this way.
Source code is included and it is distributed under the GPL
See the file COPYING for details about the GPL. If it's not in
the archive, please contact the site/person/organization you got
this program from, and tell them it is *required*
